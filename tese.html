          <p>Problem</p>
          <p>Current education often fails to engage students, lacking active, social, and exploratory elements. This contributes to issues with focus, social skills, and critical thinking. Existing educational games frequently miss the mark by superficially adding game elements without grounding in learning theory or user interaction, hindering their effectiveness. Excessive digital tech use also presents challenges.  </p>
        </div>
         <div class="intro-text">
          <p>Solution</p>
          <p>The solution proposed is the design of a new educational tool: a tabletop game for 8th-grade Natural Sciences students. Using a user-centered design approach, the project aimed to create a tool that is genuinely engaging, promotes interaction, and effectively teaches curriculum content, specifically on sustainability and natural resources.</p>

        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <p>IWho has never felt trapped in a classroom? Dreaded a test? Or maybe just not engaged with whatever was going on? 
<br><br>Maybe you’re just a maverick student, but most students have suffered from these issues, and the truth is that it’s not only understandable, it’s expected. 
<br><br>
Teachng methods haven’t been made interesting, they don’t provide feedback nor fast nor frequently enough. This leads to disengagement and slower learning. Students are also socialising less with another, there’s a lonelyness epidemic.
<br><br>
Games are extremely good at providing near instant and frequent feedback, they’re also one of the main ways we as humans interact with one another. So why don’t we try bringing them in?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container-full">
        <h2>The Who</h2>
        <p>IThere are two audiences suffering from these issues: 
<br><br>
Students and Teachers.
<br><br>Students who feel disengaged from classes are more to perform poorly. Teachers who feel like they can’t reach their students are also more at risk of underperforming. It’s an endless loop.
<br><br>
So I opted to interview the people who spend the most time with them, often more than their parents: their teachers. Soo, what did they have to say?</p>

          <p>To better understand students needs and wants I conducted  a participatory session with students where they had to build their own games or stories.<br><br>
The projects students developed, the conversations that were had and even the observation of the classroom environment provided significant insights for further project development.</p>

        <h2>The What</h2>
        <p>
            The project resulted in a collaborative engine-building card game about sustainability for 8th graders. 
            <br><br>        
            Players manage resources, build infrastructure for energy/food, and handle pollution. The design process was iterative, starting with a core concept and refining it through multiple rounds of testing and feedback to improve mechanics, balance, and user experience.
            <br><br>
            Collaboration was a key part of the game, as teachers showed great worries about students’ interpersonal skills, and a collaborative game would provide a platform for them learn to effectively communicate their ideas.
