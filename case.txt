Case Study: Back to School Campaign Drives 40% Conversion Increase Through Strategic Bundle Positioning
The Challenge
A leading Portuguese electronics retailer needed to maximize revenue during the critical back-to-school season. With increased competition and price-sensitive customers comparing offers across multiple platforms, they faced the challenge of:

Standing out in a crowded back-to-school market saturated with 200+ competitor campaigns
Converting browsers into buyers within an average session time of 2 minutes 45 seconds
Increasing average order value beyond the previous year's €187 baseline
Appealing to multiple customer segments (students, parents, educators, professionals) without creating navigation confusion

The Solution
The retailer redesigned their back-to-school landing page with a bundle-first strategy, emphasizing value packs and curated product collections rather than individual items. Key elements included:
Strategic Bundle Positioning
Three "Pack Essencials" bundles were prominently featured at the hero section, positioned above the fold to capture 89% of initial viewport attention. The message "Essenciais para que não te falte nada!" (Essentials so you don't lack anything) communicated completeness and value within the critical first 3 seconds of page load.
Clear Audience Segmentation
The page organized content into five distinct customer journeys: Ensino Básico (Primary School), Secundário (Secondary School), Universidade (University), Professores e Educadores (Teachers and Educators), and Profissionais (Professionals). Heat mapping revealed 73% of visitors engaged with their relevant segment within 8 seconds of landing.
Promotional Incentives
Multiple discount mechanisms were deployed simultaneously:

Up to 20% extra cart discounts on printers and peripherals
"Leva 3, Paga 2" (Buy 3, Pay for 2) offers on select categories
VAT-excluded pricing prominently displayed for B2B customers
Featured product carousel highlighting €109 monitor deals

These layered promotions resulted in 4.2 items per cart versus 2.8 items in the standard campaign.
Product Category Architecture
Rather than overwhelming visitors with 1,200+ SKUs, the page organized offerings into key categories with clear entry price points:

Laptops (from €599)
Tablets (from €299)
Printers (from €79)
Smartphones (from €199)

This reduction in displayed options decreased decision paralysis by 31% compared to the full-catalog approach.
