    <ProblemSolution>
      <template #problem>
        The transition from secondary education is a stressful period for many
        young people, compounded by uncertainty about future paths. Choosing a
        course or career often happens without adequate guidance, leading to
        suboptimal choices and potential dissatisfaction. Existing platforms
        often lack engaging user experiences, appearing overly serious or
        having confusing navigation, which exacerbates student anxiety.
      </template>
      <template #solution>
        Upling is a digital platform conceived during a bachelor's course in
        graphic/interaction design. Its primary goal is to provide young
        people with an easy and interactive way to find an educational path
        that aligns with their needs and goals. While focusing on guiding high
        school seniors towards higher education or the job market, it also
        aims to serve college students and professionals seeking new skills.

    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Our research focused on understanding the emotional and practical
      challenges students face during the transition to higher education. We
      conducted interviews with high school students to better understand how
      they perceive the transition to higher education and the struggles they
      face during this period.

    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      From our research we managed to identify specific needs based on things
      these students feel are missing:
