        Boaty is an independent beatmaker from Portugal. As an artist he draws
        inspiration from internet culture, anime, and portuguese pop culture and
        mixes those elements with his own vision and style producing a modern
        and creative style of trap.

        While developing Boaty's logo I wanted to create something that would
        convey the elements that define him as an artist. His creativity, his
        style, his background, where he came from and to where he is going.
