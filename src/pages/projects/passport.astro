        This project was done as a way to better understand services and how we
        can improve them with new technologies. To start off we had to better
        understand the users of said services and their struggles with the
        current iteration of the service, in this case: The Passport and Travel
        Systems.

      <p class="opacity-90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 pb-30">
        Through interviews and research on the typical users and frustrations
        related to passports and travelling we landed on 4 different user types,
        or personas.

        Upon figuring out how the system could be improved we wanted to develop
        a new interface for the passport, one that would not only serve as an
        official document but could also double as a travel companion and record
        all your most precious moments while traveling.
